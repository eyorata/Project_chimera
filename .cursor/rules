# Project Chimera - Cursor Rules

## Project Context
This is Project Chimera, an autonomous influencer system.

## Prime Directive
NEVER generate code without checking specs/ first.

## Traceability Rules
All code must map back to:
- specs/functional.md
- specs/technical.md

## Workflow
Before coding:
1. Read specs/
2. Explain the plan
3. List files to modify
4. Then implement

## Safety Requirements
Publishing actions must require explicit approval checkpoints.
Never hardcode API keys.
